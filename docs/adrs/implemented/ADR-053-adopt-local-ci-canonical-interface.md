# ADR-053: Adopt the Local CI Canonical Interface

**Status:** Implemented

**Date:** 2026-08-17

**Amends:** [ADR-012](./ADR-012-constrain-local-tooling-to-macos.md), [ADR-017](./ADR-017-prune-redundant-package-scripts.md), [ADR-031](./ADR-031-use-agent-ci-warm-cache-serialization.md), [ADR-034](./ADR-034-emit-agent-ci-progress-events.md), [ADR-036](./ADR-036-prewarm-agent-ci-dependencies-explicitly.md), [ADR-046](./ADR-046-scope-local-agent-ci-to-workflow-sensitive-changes.md)

## Context

Agent CI 0.18 renamed the project to Local CI. The canonical npm package is
`run-local-ci`, the executable is `local-ci`, and new configuration uses
`.env.local-ci` plus `LOCAL_CI_*` variables. The old
`@redwoodjs/agent-ci` package is now a compatibility shim that warns on every
invocation and forwards to Local CI. Legacy names remain supported only as
compatibility aliases through the upstream `0.x` release line.

The template deliberately exposes its local workflow through a pinned
dependency, repository scripts, an agent skill, and reusable documentation.
Continuing to publish the old names would make new clones start on a deprecated
interface and defer the same migration to every downstream project.

## Decision

Use `run-local-ci` as the pinned development dependency and invoke its
`local-ci` executable from the existing `ci:local` and `ci:local:retry` npm
scripts. Preserve those npm script names as the repository's stable public
commands.

Use `.env.local-ci`, `LOCAL_CI_*` environment variables, and the
repository-local `local-ci` skill for new configuration and agent guidance.
Keep `.env.agent-ci` ignored so existing machine-local compatibility files
cannot be committed accidentally, but do not recommend legacy names in active
documentation.

The existing prewarm selector, structured event stream, pause-and-retry loop,
workflow-sensitive validation boundary, and Docker-based execution model do
not change.

## Trigger

The project dependency refresh reached Local CI 0.18.0 and exposed the upstream
rename through the compatibility package's deprecation warning.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- New clones use the upstream project's supported package, executable, and
  configuration names directly.
- Local runs avoid the compatibility-package warning and a redundant shim
  dependency.
- Repository docs, specs, and agent routing share one canonical vocabulary.

**Negative:**

- Existing downstream projects must rename their dependency, executable,
  machine-local env file, environment variables, and skill path when they adopt
  this update.
- Contributors with an existing `.env.agent-ci` file should rename it to use
  the documented configuration path, even though the legacy file remains
  temporarily supported upstream.

**Neutral:**

- The stable `npm run ci:local` and `npm run ci:local:retry` interfaces remain
  unchanged.
- Historical ADRs and update packs keep the Agent CI name that was correct when
  those decisions and migrations were recorded.

## Alternatives Considered

### Upgrade the Compatibility Package Only

Pinning `@redwoodjs/agent-ci` 0.18.0 would preserve every old repository name,
but each invocation would warn and new clones would depend on an interface that
upstream has already replaced. That is a poor default for a reusable template.

### Keep Legacy Configuration Names with the Canonical Package

Local CI accepts `.env.agent-ci` and `AGENT_CI_*` during the `0.x` line, but
standardizing on those aliases would make a later compatibility removal more
disruptive and leave active guidance inconsistent with upstream documentation.
