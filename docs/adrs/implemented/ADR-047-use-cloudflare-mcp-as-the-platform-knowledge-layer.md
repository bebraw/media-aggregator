# ADR-047: Use Cloudflare MCP As The Platform Knowledge Layer

**Status:** Implemented

**Date:** 2026-07-31

## Context

The template vendors broad and product-specific Cloudflare skills in both `.codex/skills/` and `.github/skills/`. Much of that material duplicates current documentation and API knowledge now available through the connected Cloudflare MCP, while increasing repository size and maintenance work.

The Worker starter still benefits from focused implementation guardrails and Wrangler workflow guidance that apply directly to its source, tests, and local development setup.

## Decision

Use the connected Cloudflare MCP for current product documentation, API discovery, and account operations.

Keep `workers-best-practices` and `wrangler` as the template's baseline Cloudflare skills in both supported skill locations. Remove the general `cloudflare`, `agents-sdk`, `cloudflare-email-service`, and `durable-objects` bundles. Add product-specific skills later only when a project adopts the corresponding capability.

## Trigger

The user adopted Cloudflare's MCP and asked whether the existing vendored Cloudflare skill suite was still necessary, then approved pruning it.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Current Cloudflare facts and API shapes come from the connected platform source.
- The repository drops a large duplicated documentation snapshot.
- Baseline skills stay aligned with the Worker starter's actual implementation and local CLI workflow.
- Specialized guidance becomes an explicit, on-demand project choice.

**Negative:**

- Cloudflare product work without an MCP connection may require installing a specialized skill or consulting external documentation.
- Projects adopting Agents SDK, Durable Objects, or Email Service must add the corresponding guidance deliberately.

**Neutral:**

- Wrangler remains the local development and deployment CLI.
- The change does not alter Worker runtime behavior or Cloudflare account state.

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep Every Cloudflare Skill

This preserves offline reference material but duplicates the MCP's current documentation and API capabilities while retaining substantial maintenance and repository weight.

### Remove Every Cloudflare Skill

This is smaller, but it discards useful Worker implementation guardrails and local Wrangler procedures that the MCP does not replace.

### Keep Only The General Cloudflare Skill

The general skill is broadest but overlaps most heavily with MCP retrieval. It is less useful for this starter than the focused Worker and Wrangler workflows.
